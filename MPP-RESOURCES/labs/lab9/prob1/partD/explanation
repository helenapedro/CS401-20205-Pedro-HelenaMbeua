Problems: Employee.equals and hashCode include the mutable field visited.
EmployeeInfo.removeDuplicates stores Employee as a key in a HashMap, and
then later does tracker.get(e).setVisited(true). Changing a field that
participates in hashCode() after the object is used as a key breaks the mapâ€™s
invariants and causes subtle failures.
