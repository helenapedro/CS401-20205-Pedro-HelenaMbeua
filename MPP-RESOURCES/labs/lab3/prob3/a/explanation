Case1: Using Inheritance (as in the UML diagram)
    Here, the design says Cylinder extends Circle.
        * That means a Cylinder is-a Circle.
        * It reuses the radius field from Circle and adds height.

Does it make sense to use inheritance here?
    Not really, a Cylinder is not a Circle; rather, it has a Circle base.
    So the inheritance relationship is a bit forced. This is one of those
    “wrong uses of inheritance for convenience” examples mentioned in the slides.
