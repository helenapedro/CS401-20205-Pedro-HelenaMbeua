Case2: Using Composition
    Here, a Cylinder is not a Circle (though it has one as a base),
    so composition models reality more accurately.

    Inheritance should only be used when thereâ€™s a true IS-before.A relationship
    and when the subclass can safely substitute for the superclass without
    breaking behavior (Liskov Substitution Principle).
