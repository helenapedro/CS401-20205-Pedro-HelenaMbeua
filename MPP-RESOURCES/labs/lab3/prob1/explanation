Case1:
    System.out.println("p1.equals(p2)? " + p1.equals(p2)); // false

    p1 is PersonWithJob and p2 is Person, PersonWithJob has its own form of equals,
    which creates a serious problem called 'asymmetry'. 'p1.equals(p2)' compares two
    objects using PersonWithJob equals method. It compares two object's name. If the name
    is not equal return false, otherwise it compares two object's salary.
    p1 has salary 30000, p2 doesn't have salary.


Case2:
    System.out.println("p2.equals(p1)? " + p2.equals(p1)); // true

    The comparation between the two objects here is made by
    using Person's equal method. It compares two object's name.
    If the name is not equal return false, otherwise returns true
	p1 name is "Joe" and p2 name is also "Joe"
